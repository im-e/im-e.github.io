      <p>
        i've always had videogames as my main passion since i was young, and always knew i wanted to work within the gaming sphere.
        sharing a passion between playing and wanting to make games, i've been heavily interested in competitive titles and development, expanding my skills in both as i've grown up.
        <br>
        <br>
        i love learning new skills and being a creative. i have a wide breadth of interests and hobbies outside of gaming such as editing, music, food, to language that i like to explore and develop. 
        i like to combine them together in unique ways, such as creating audio-visual art, or learning to cook foods and drinks from different countries and cultures.
