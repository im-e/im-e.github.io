      <h2>introduction</h2>
      <p>
        i've always had videogames as my main passion since i was young, and always knew i wanted to work within the gaming sphere.
        sharing a passion between playing and wanting to make games, i've been heavily interested in competitive titles and development, expanding my skills in both as i've grown up.<br>
        <br>
        i love learning new skills and being a creative. i have a wide breadth of interests and hobbies outside of gaming such as video editing, music, food, and languages that i like to explore and develop. 
        i like to combine them together in unique ways, such as creating audio-visual art, or learning to cook foods and drinks from different countries and cultures. <br>
        <br>
        a few short facts: my favourite game is sound voltex! i am an active learner of japanese and my favourite food is nduja pasta!

        <h4>bloodthirst - c#, unity (ludum dare 51 game jam entry)</h4>
        <p>
          bloodthirst is an old school fps doom-like game that was created entirely on my own in 48 hours for the ludum dare 51 game jam based upon the theme 'every 10 seconds'.
          every asset and piece of code was made entirely from scratch and by myself within those 48 hours. it was ranked in the top 300 of 2450 entries, and ranked in the top 100 for 'mood'.<br>
          <br>

          in bloodthirst, you must reach the end of the level before succumbing to blood loss which takes 10 seconds, killing an enemy will refill your supply reset the timer. 
          your health, and ammo also depend on your blood supply, so every action is critical, and every second is too. a missed shot, or bullet taken can be the factor between death or success.<br> 
          <br>
          it has an advanced first person character controller and movement system, shooting and melee mechanic, ai enemies with projectile bullets, 
          'fuel and life' blood system, introduction and game end screen, level summary screen and shader effects.<br>
          you can play it in your browser on my itch page: <a href="https://nearnoah.itch.io/bloodthirst">https://nearnoah.itch.io/bloodthirst</a>

        <h4>rave Beat - c#, unity</h4>
        <p>
          rave Beat is a rhythm game with acessiblity focused design, that still challenges and trains the rhythmical ability of the player.<br>
          it was developed independently by myself for my final year project in my third year of university. <br>
          <br>
          i conducted resarch and wrote a paper alongside the design process and development of the game, 
          i looked at how rhythm games can improve ones rhythmical skill, and how rhythmical skills can improve ones health and learning abilities in the real world.
          my paper also looked into the design of rhythm games, critiquing the downsides they had in terms of accessibility and how many have unfocused design around rhythm timing.
          i used my resarch to design rave beat to be playable to all, while ensuring the gameplay was focused around rhythmical ability.<br> 
          <br>
          it has a precise timing and real-time feedback system
          The game is fully implemented and functional with a main menu, in-game UI, ranking and records system, alternate gameplay mode, and saving.  
          you can find the code, and my paper on the github repo: <a href="https://github.com/im-e/rave-beat">https://github.com/im-e/rave-beat</a>

        <p>
          i created a game engine in c++, focusing on abrstaction oriented design to allow other apis/libraries to be implemented. 
          features of the engine include: basic rendering, shaders, textures, 
          asset and resource manager, logger, window system, input polling, mouse and keyboard events, wirst person camera controller and a 3d positional audio system using fmod.

        <h4>minecraft server plugins - java</h4>
        <p>
          i have made several plugins for minecraft using spigot, paper apis. for my own hosted severs, friends and even commissioned to make a plugin for another server owner.
          some of these inculde: hardore server plugins, using timed bans upon deaths with included grace periods. server rankings, permission plugins, house area allocation plugins.
