      <h2>Additional Projects</h2>
      <img src="../src/images/robotics.png" alt="Robotics"></img>
      <h3>Robot AI Programming</h3>
      <p>
        Robotics was a third year university module where the main assement piece of the module was to program a robot that has an advanced collision detection system, using LUA scripting inside CoppeliaSim(V-REP). 
        I was tasked to create several states for the AI and create a logic-flow that goes between each state to give the AI a completed behaviour. The AI was then tested to be able to consistently traverse a room, without hitting and obstacles.
      </p>
      <h4>Features</h4>
      <li>Collision detection and avoidance</li>
      <li>AI state machine - wander, avoid, follow/track states</li>
      <li>Edge tracking/following</li>
      <br>

      <img src="../src/images/building.png" alt="Building Escape"></img>
      <h3>Building Escape</h3>
      <p>
        Building Escape is a physics based puzzle game which is my first game made in Unreal Engine using C++.
        It is a short experience where the player must figure out the puzzle and move objects to trigger switches and open doors to progress throughout the building and escape the premises.
      </p>
      <h4>Features</h4>
      <li>First person character controller</li>
      <li>Item pickup and rotation mechanic</li>
      <li>Item checking trigger system</li>
      <br>

      <img src="../src/images/shaderdemo.png" alt="Shader Demo"></img>
      <h3>Shader Programming Demo</h3>
      <p>
        This shader programming demo was an assessment piece for my third year module Shader Programming.
        It required us to make a scene to implement basic shader programming techniques in C++/OpenGL.
      </p>
      <h4>Features</h4>
      <li>Lighting - Phong, Blinn-Phong</li>
      <li>Mapping - Specular Mapping, Normal Mapping, Parallax Mapping, Texture Mapping</li>
      <li>Model Shading - Shading working on model imports using ASSIMP</li>
      <br>

      <img src="../src/images/webdev.png" alt="Front End Website Development"></img>
      <h3>Front End Website Development</h3>
      <p>
        I am experienced in front end web development using HTML/CSS and Javascript being able to create and design websites, just like the one you are on right now! <br>
        I have made websites for myself, and I have been paid to make websites for other people. 
      </p>
      <h4>Websites</h4>
      <li>Portfolios</li>
      <li>Social media link pages</li>
      <li>Informational and organisation pages</li>
      <br>  

      <img src="../src/images/mandlebrot.png" alt="Mandlebrot Explorer"></img>
      <h3>Mandlebrot Explorer</h3>
      <p>
        Mandlebrot Explorer is an interactive viewer for the Mandlebrot set made inside Unity.
        It is styled with shaders to make the set fun to browse and look around in. <br>
        I created it for fun, as I am really interested by complex dynamics and enjoy the art you can make with sets of complex numbers.
      </p>
      <h4>Features</h4>
      <li>Stylistic shading and color cycling</li>
      <li>Viewing controls with zooming and panning</li>
      <li>A great way to experience the Mandlebrot set!</li>
      <br>

      <img src="../src/images/minecraft.png" alt="Minecraft Plugins"></img>
      <h3>Minecraft Plugins</h3>
      <p>
        I have coded several server side plugins for Minecraft, using the Spigot and Paper APIs in Java. <br>
        I did this to have more fun playing with friends on servers, creating my own plugins to enhance the experience of the game to make it more difficult and exciting.
      </p>
      <h4>Plugins</h4>
      <li>CatnipsPlugin - 24 hour ban death punishment mod</li>
      <li>DeathStats - Infomation and rankings for player deaths</li>
      <li>Mod Compatibility Plugins - Created plugins to allow other plugins to share information</li>
      <br>

      <img src="../src/images/marble.png" alt="Super Marble Run"></img>
      <h3>Super Marble Run</h3>
      <p>
        My first ever game solo development project made in Unity, it is a marble platformer game for mobile phones. <br>
        Roll your way around the level, collect all the gems in each level and use the powerups at hand to reach the goal. <br>
        It was created as part of my Mobile Games module assessment piece in the second year of university. <br>
      </p>
      <h4>Features</h4>
      <li>Powerup modifiers for jump, speed and gravity</li>
      <li>Gem collection requirement for level completion</li>
      <br>

      <img src="../src/images/racer.png" alt="Top-Down Racer"></img>
      <h3>Top-Down Racer</h3>
      <p>
        Top-Down Racer was a 2D physics based racing game made in C++ using SFML as a graphics library and Box2D as a 2D physics library. <br>
        It was part of my second year C++ Programming module as our final assessment piece where we were tasked to make a 2D physics game themed on 'sports'. <br>
      </p>
      <h4>Features</h4>
      <li>Physics based racing, with individual wheel control</li>
      <li>Timed lap system, around a loop track</li>
      <li>Object Oriented Design</li>
