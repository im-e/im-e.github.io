      <h3>Ludum Dare 51 Compo Entry</h3>
      <p>
          Ludum Dare is a seasonal game jam and is one of the most popular game jams in the world. The 'Compo' (Competiton) part of the jam challenges developers to make a game within 48 hours based around a theme that is revealed at the start of the competition. The games under Compo must be completely independently developed and consisting of work (Music, Animations, Sprites, Code, etc...) that is made by the single developer inside that 48 hour time frame.<br> <br>

          The theme of Ludum Dare 51 was 'Every 10 seconds'. Bloodthirst is a single player, old school FPS game set in a post-apocalyptic setting. The player is tasked to kill the enemies in the area while running on a 'blood' system which drains every 10 seconds. As enemies are killed it refuels the injector which the player can use to refill their system and continue with the mission. <br>
          Once the system has been drained, the player will enter a rage state which will continue draining the system over another 10 seconds, if the player does not refill the system in time, they will fail the mission. <br> <br>

          Everything in Bloodthirst was designed, created and developed by myself within 48 hours. I used Unity to develop the game using C#, I used Sfxr to generate all the sound effects for the game and Piskel to create all of the sprites and textures you see in the game.
